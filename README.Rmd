# lagree

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lagree is to consolidate and organize the calcualtion of interrater agreement statistics, standard errors, and confidence intervals.

Credit for this work goes to Kilem L. Gwet, Ph.D. He generously provides the R code to calculate these agreement statistics. I've wrapped his code into my own functions that output `tibble` data frames for my convenience. Please check out his work and his website: [AgreeStat.com](http://agreestat.com/index.html).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("emilelatour/lagree")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(lagree)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
